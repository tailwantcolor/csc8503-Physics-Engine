This is a help document.

For Game1, you can select the objects in the world to change their cRestitution to make your ball
cross from the left side of the floor to the right side. 

The standard way is to select the "JumpPad" and "ForwardCapsule" and press the key "G" to 
make the gravity on. In principle, you should not control the ball itself by locking it. However, if 
you want, I didn't make the function disable.

For Game2, DLC, The story is that you are the hero of the coins. And you should collect the other
coins , maybe your family members or friend? To avoid they are eaten by the enemy, you can use
the magic floor! 

Magic floor is the cubes in the second layer, under the coins and you can select them to trigger.
If they are triggered, the magic can not be cancelled. Some magic is good and some is bad. You 
can try it.

But the conditions to the ends is not very good , so there are some bugs like you finished the end
 but you do not achieve the success.(maybe try again)

The next content may influence your game experience. If you are sure , continue.  

Magic floor have 4 kinds.
Freeze floors have large friction. Accelerate floors can accelerate the velocity.
They are just for the player.
Jump floors can make the coins get higher and Empty floors will remove the cube.
They are for all objects.

You will find that if the player has a collision with the coins, they will remove the coins and the score
become less. However, that means that it's not good for you to collect the coins by yourself.
But the AI will also collect the coins and make your score lower.

So you should find the way to make the player or the AI fall from the floor before they get the coins.
And you can protect the score and the coins, Like the empty floors.
